About TInF
===========

The intended audience for this tool is researchers and practitioners
interested in predicting the response of a structure to wind
events.

The Turbulence Inflow Tool (TInF) is designed to collect all required properties and parameters needed for various turbulence inflow models in OpenFOAM, and to augment an existing wind-around-a-building model by adding the necessary sections to respective parameter definition files.

This document covers Version 1.1 of the tool. Users are encouraged to comment on what additional features and
capabilities they would like to see in this application. These requests and feedback can be submitted through
