A successful run or
download of a job that ran successfully will result in 3 tabbed
widgets being displayed in the results panel.  The first tab, as shown in
\Cref{fig:results_summary}m shows summary statistics: mean and
stdDev values or min-max values (if discrete set is used to define one or more of the random variables, e.g multiple events)
are shown for each of the EDP's specified. The second panel,
shown in \Cref{fig:summary_information} shows the summary
information from Dakota output file containing other statstics generated by Dakota.

\end{figure}

The third panel, shown in \Cref{fig:results_data} presents the results both
graphically and in tabular form. By selecting different
columns with left and right mouse buttons in the table below the
graphic, the information in the graph is changed. Selecting the left
mouse button changes the Y axis, the right mouse changes the X
axis. If the same column is selected using both left and right keys,
either the CDF and PDF is displayed. If the last mouse press was with the left
button, the PDF will be displayed; if the last mouse press was the right one, the CDF
will be displayed.
 
Regarding the columns in the table below the figure: You will see a column for each random variable the workflow came across and then the columns for the response quantaties. There may be more random variables than you specified. This is because certain applications the user selected may introduce additional random varaibles for the UQ engine to consider.
