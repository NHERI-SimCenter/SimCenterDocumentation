On Windows operating systems, if you receive an error when starting the application with the message that MSVCP140.dll is missing as shown in \Cref{fig:Missing_CRT_Error}, it is caused by a missing Visual C/C++ runtime library. You can fix this error by running the installer for the Visual C/C++ redistributable package (vc\_redist.x64.exe) which is included with the application.
