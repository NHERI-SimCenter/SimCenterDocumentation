**************************
Run Remotely on DesignSafe
**************************

There are two ways to run the applications remotely on DesignSafe: one is through the `Data Depot <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/>`_ user interface on DesignSafe, where job details are submitted through a Jupyter notebook. The other is by calling on Tapis CLI directly through Ubuntu.


Prepare Input Files
==========================

1. Prepare the input files in a folder called ``input_data``, then zip the folder. You may use this example input file set (:download:`input_data_eq.zip <files/input_data_eq.zip>`) as a template.


2. Prepare workflow settings in the configuration file. You may use the example configuration file (:download:`rWHALE_config_remote.json <files/rWHALE_config_remote.json>`) as a template.


      - Set ``'runDir'`` to ``/tmp/rWhale/``.
      - Set ``'localAppDir'`` to ``/tmp/rWhale/``.
      - Specify applications for each workflow step and their inputs. For more details on the format of the configuration file, see :ref:`Inputs <lblUserDefInputs>`.


3. Upload the zipped ``input_data`` file and configuration file to "My Data" on the DesignSafe `Data Depot <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/data/browser/>`_.


4. Upload the :download:`CreateLauncherTasks script <files/CreateLauncherTasks.py>` and a Jupyter notebook with commands for setting up the job on Tapis. You can use this example Jupyter Notebook (:download:`run_rWHALE.ipynb <files/run_rWHALE.ipynb>`) as a template.

On DesignSafe, the files should appear on Data Depot as:

Run Job Through Jupyter
==========================

This method uses Jupyter Notebook to run the job, accessing Tapis CLI in the backend.


5. Click on the ``run_rWHALE.ipynb`` notebook, then click **Open in Jupyter**. You will be taken to a new page for editing the Jupyter Notebook.

   :figclass: align-center


6. Specify settings for running the job on Frontera. Submit the job by running all cells in the Jupyter Notebook (Cell > Run All).

.. .. jsonschema:: App_Schema.json#/properties/runRemote


7. To view the status of the job, navigate to the **Workspace** on DesignSafe. The right bar will list all jobs that have been submitted in order of newest to oldest. Job outputs can be accessed by clicking on "More Info" on the job.

   :figclass: align-center


8. To access the job outputs, click on "More Info" on the job. It will navigate you to the job archive folder on Data Depot.

      - The aggregated outputs are saved in HDF files: "DM.hdf", "DV.hdf", and "EDP.hdf" contain the EDP and DL summary results for all built assets. "realizations.hd5" contains the response simulation results for every event simulated per built asset.
      - "launcher.err" contains error messages produced from running the job.
      - "launcher.out" contains the log file.

Submit Job Through Tapis
==========================

This method submits the job using Tapis CLI directly. If using Windows,  this is executed in the Ubuntu subsystem. Please refer to Chapter 9 of the `Tapis How-To Guide <https://www.designsafe-ci.org/media/filer_public/90/d5/90d5ff98-3ca1-40a5-a2cb-2ead8f51ecb9/tapis-cli-how-to-guide-readthedocs-io-en-latest.pdf>`_  for more details.

5. First, ensure that Tapis CLI is installed on your computer. Open a Ubuntu window and install Tapis CLI using ``pip``:

      ``pip install tapis-cli``


Or, install Tapis CLI from Github:

.. code-block:: console

      git clone https://github.com/TACC-Cloud/tapis-cli-ng.git
      cd tapis-cli-ng/
      pip install --upgrade --user .


6. Set up a Tapis session on each host where you will use the Tapis CLI. This is a one-time operation where you will be asked to agree to terms, select a tenant, and finally enter a username and password for that tenant. Run the command:

      ``tapis auth init``


You will see an output in the Ubuntu window similar to the following.

      - Select "y" to the prompts.
      - Set ``tenant_name`` to "designsafe".
      - Set ``username`` and ``password`` to your TACC username and password.
      - Keep ``registry_url`` to ``https://index.docker.io``
      - Set ``git_username`` and ``git_token`` to your Github account details. See directions `here <https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line>`_ for more information on generating a git token.

7. Initialize a job with the name "R2D_test_run" by executing the command:

      ``tapis jobs init rWhale-2.1.0 --name R2D_test_run > job.json``

8. A job.json file is created. You may make changes to this file using VIM Editor, by running the command:

      ``vim job.json``

9. Edit the job.json file to specify settings for running the job on Frontera. To make edits in the VIM Editor, type ``Ctrl+I``. To exit out of the editor, type ``:wq``.


10. Once the job.json file is prepared, submit the job by running the command:

      ``tapis jobs submit -F job.json``

An ACCEPTED status indicates the job.json was valid, and e-mail alerts (if they were specified in job.json) will track
the progress of the job. Also, take note of the long hexadecimal ID (*job ID*) when you submit the job. This identifier can be
used to track progress and download results.

11. To check on the status of a particular job, run the following command with the job ID:

      ``tapis jobs status <job ID>``

12. Once the job has been completed, the results can be downloaded either from the job archives (accessed from the Workspace on DesignSafe) or directly from Tapis, with the following command:

      ``tapis jobs outputs download --progress <job ID string>``

Or, to download a specific file from the outputs,

      ``tapis jobs outputs download <job ID> <name of file>``
