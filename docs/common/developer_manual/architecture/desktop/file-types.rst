File Types and Schemas
**********************

In order to run an instance of the workflow, users must prepare the **input files** according to a standard file schema (the file type, structure, and contents). If input files deviate from this schema, then the workflow will return errors. Upon completion of the workflow, **output files** containing a summary of simulation results are produced.

For a guide on formatting input files and reading output files, refer to the following pages:
