.. only:: R2D_app

	  Verification for |app| is performed as part of the `testbed work <file:///Users/fmckenna/release/SimCenterDocumentation/build/R2DTool/html/common/testbeds/atlantic_city/sample_results.html>`_. For each tesbed manual evaluation of randomly selected buildings from th testbed is performed by hand calculation to ensure the results for that building match the output results from the software.
