   quoFEM Requirements
   ===================
   
   The following are the requirements are being for the quoFEM application. quoFEM is an
   application proving UQ and Optimization methods to existing FEM applications. quoFEM
   has a lower level interface to UQ and Optimization methods than the other applications
   (WE-UQ, EE-UQ, and PBE). It is thus a more powerful tool providing more capabilities for
   researchers. All requirements in this section are related to work in sections 1.3.7, 1.3.8,
   and 1.3.9of the WBS.

   The purpose of presenting these requirements is to inform the community on the present capabilities of the |app| and features that could be added. The original set of requirements have come from a set of grand challenge reports, **GC**. These original requirements have been broken into a smaller set of deliverable features by the senior faculty associated with the project, **SP**. Additional requirements have come from users, **U** See section :ref:`features` if you have additional features you would like to see.
