General Requirements
------------------------------
The following are the requirements for the response of a single structure due to wave or hydrodynamic loading effects of water caused by a tsunami or coastal inundation during a hurricane. The requirements are being met by the Hydro-UQ application. All requirements in this section are related to work in WBS 1.3.7.
