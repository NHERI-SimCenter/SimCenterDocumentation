Requirements
************

The following page contains the functional requirements for the **HydroUQ application**. These requirements are broken down into a number of groups, **general**, **surge/tsunami loading**, **building description**, **analysis**, **UQ**, **RV**, and **CR**.

The purpose of presenting these requirements is to inform the community about the present capabilities of the **HydroUQ application** and features that could be added. The original set of requirements has come from a set of grand challenge reports, **GC**. These original requirements have been broken into a smaller set of deliverable features by the senior faculty associated with the project, **SP**. Additional requirements have come from users, **U**. Go to the :ref:`Bugs & Feature Requests <lblBugs>` section if there are additional features you would like to see added.
