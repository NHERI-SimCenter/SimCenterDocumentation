Bugs & Feature Requests
************************

If you find bugs, have feature requests, or have questions about how to install or use the application, please post on the |messageBoard|. 
To avoid duplication, try the `Search` feature before creating a `New Topic`. When creating a `New Topic` to report a bug or new feature request it would be helpful if you could place in the `Subject` area, as shown in :numref:`figBugReport`, an indication of what the post is about:

.. contents:: Table of Contents
	:local:
	:depth: 2
	:backlinks: none

.. _features:

Feature Requests
================

For new feature requests, give a high-level description in the `Subject`, i.e., FEATURE: Incorporate OpenSeesPy, with added detail in the body.

If you can relate the feature request to a unimplemented requirement in the `Requirements` section of the documentation, that will increase the importance of the feature for our team.
