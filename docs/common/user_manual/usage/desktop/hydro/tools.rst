Tools
*****

The main menu toolbar, i.e. the ribbon at the top of the |app|, contains the ``Tools`` dropdown menu. Tools in HydroUQ are standalone applications that create inputs for certain workflow applications, e.g. the **Digital Twin (Material Point Method)** tool provides ready-made digital twins of wave-flumes which are used to compute the engineering demand parameters for use on structures within flumes. At a later time, results from a tool can be brought back into the main SimCenter workflow.
