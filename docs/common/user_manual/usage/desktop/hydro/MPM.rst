=====================
Material Point Method
=====================

The ``MPM`` event option is used to setup the flow parameters related to the water-borne hazard event. This can either be a coupling between the shallow-water and MPM solver or using the ClaymoreUW MPM solver alone. The steps of the setup process for the event have been kept nearly similar to that often used in Finite Element Method to make it easier for researchers from structural engineering background to easily use this application. This includes ``SettingsMPM`` >> ``BodiesMPM`` >> ``BoundariesMPM`` >> ``SensorsMPM`` >> ``OutputsMPM``. Figure :numref:`HydroSteps_MPM` shows the steps as selectable tab-pages in the GUI.
