Settings
***********************************************

Settings for the simulation that are not specific to a body, boundary, or sensor (i.e. global settings) are collected here. They sort into a few primary categories:

- **Simulation Settings**: These are settings that are not specific to any particular part of the simulation, such as the time step, the number of steps, and the output frequency.
- **Scaling Settings**: These are settings that are used to scale the simulation, such as the length scale and the time scale. These are used to convert the simulation from a dimensionless form to a form that is more relevant to the physical system being modeled (e.g. a model wave-flume or prototype wave event). 
- **Computer Settings**: These are settings that are specific to the computer being used, such as the number of graphics processing units (GPU) and compile-time memory allocations.
