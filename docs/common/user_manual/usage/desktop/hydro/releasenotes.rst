    **User Interface**

        Significant overhaul of the Event GUI to allow for a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. Includes backend updates to the schema and application logic to support the new features.

        #. **Settings**

            * Panel for setting simulation parameters (e.g. time step, characteristic length, domain size, CFL number).
            * Panel for setting computer parameters (e.g. number of cores, number of GPUs, etc.).
            * Panel for setting similitude parameters (e.g. Froude scale, Cauchy scale, etc.).

        #. **Bodies**

            Any entity in a simulation that is not a boundary condition or sensor is considered a ``Body``. ``Bodies``, the collection of ``Body`` objects, may be composed of particles, or meshes. Each ``Body`` is specified by its ``Material``, ``Geometry``, ``Algorithm``, and ``Partitions``.

            #. **Material**

                #. Supports ``elastic``, ``hyperelastic``, and ``elasto-plastic`` material models.
                
                #. New constitutive laws:

                    * ``J-Fluid``: Weakly-compressible isotropic fluid with viscous shear stress. Uses the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state. 
                    * ``Fixed-Corotated``: Hyperelastic material model for plastic and rubber-like materials.
                    * ``Neo-Hookean``: Hyperelastic material model for plastic and rubber-like materials.
                    * ``Drucker-Prager``: Applicable to granular materials, concrete, and other materials with a yield surface.
                    * ``Non-Associative Cam-Clay``: Aplicable to clays, concrete, and other topology changing material bodies


            #. **Geometry**

                * Added a composable geometry editor for creating and modifying geometry.
                * Implemented boolean operations for geometry (e.g. union, intersection, difference).
                * Implemented array operations for geometry (e.g. create an array of the same geometry at specified spacings in X, Y, and Z).
                * Implemented rotation operations for geometry (e.g. rotate a geometry about an axis by a specified angle).
                * Implemented translation operations for geometry (e.g. translate a geometry by a specified distance in X, Y, and Z).
                * Implemented geometry file import from ``.sdf`` files.
                * Added geometry primitives (e.g. ``sphere``, ``box``, ``cylinder``).

            #. **Algorithm**

                * Implemented Affine Particle-in-Cell (APIC) algorithm for ``MPM``
                * Implemented Fluid-Implicit Particles (FLIP) algorithm for ``MPM``
                * Implemented Affine-Separable Fluid-Implicit Particles (ASFIP) algorithm for ``MPM``
                * Implemented F-Bar volumetric antilocking algorithm for ``MPM``
                * Implemented quadratic B-Spline shape functions for ``MPM``

            #. **Partitions**

                * Bodies may be split across multiple hardware partitions.
                * Accelerates simulation times by running multiple bodies in parallel.
                * A valid hardware partition may be a core, a GPU, or a node in an HPC cluster.
                * Each partition may hold some maximum number of bodies at once (specific to the system which the simulating tool was compiled on).

        #. **Boundaries**

            Any object in a simulation that is not a sensor or body is considered a ``Boundary``. ``Boundaries``, the collection of ``Boundary`` objects, are enforced boundary conditions which may apply to parts of the simulation (e.g. on grid-nodes or particles).

            * Added boundaries for geometry primitives (e.g. ``sphere``, ``box``, ``cylinder``).
            * Added selectable contact models (e.g. ``Sticky``, ``Slip``, ``Separable``).
            * Added boundaries for the ``OSU LWF`` and ``WU TWB`` digital twin bathymetries. 
            * Added boundary for the ``OSU LWF`` moving piston wave-maker. 
            * Implemented array operations for boundary conditions (e.g. instace a boundary at specified spacings in X, Y, and Z).

        #. **Sensors**

            Any object in a simulation that is not a boundary condition or body is considered a ``Sensor``. ``Sensors``, the collection of ``Sensor`` objects, are used to monitor the simulation, collect desired data, reduce said data, and report the aggregated output as a time-series. In effect, they replicate instruments / sensors used in experiments (e.g. load-cells, wave-gauges, piezometers, velocimeters).

            * Sensors may be placed on numerical bodies (e.g. on ``particles`` or ``grid-nodes`` for ``MPM``) to monitor the simulation.
            * Supports force, pressure, velocity, and elevation sensors by default.
            * Custom sensors may be added to the simulation through the GUI.
            * Supports automatic reduction operations (e.g. sum, average, max, min) to reduce sensor data to a single scalar or vector value per sampling step.
            * Allows specification of sensor output frequency.

        #. **Outputs**

            Collection of simulation settings that do not effect the simulation itself, but rather the output it gives to the user.

            * Supports output of simulation geometry data in the form of ``.bgeo`` files, ``.vtk`` files, and ``.csv`` files.
            * Supports output of simulation sensor data in the form of ``.csv`` and ``.txt`` files.
            * Supports output of simulation state data in the form of ``.bgeo`` files.
            * Enable / disable tracking of and output of simulation energy (kinetic, strain, etc.).
            * Enable / disable output of simulation checkpoints (allow for a simulation to be resumed if stopped).

    **Visualization**

        * Enabled visualization of the Event (``EVT``) using ``Qt3D``
        * Added support for mouse controls of camera in 3D visualization.
        * Added support for visualizing simulation ``Bodies`` in 3D.
        * Added support for visualizing simulation ``Boundaries`` in 3D.
        * Added support for visualizing simulation ``Sensors`` in 3D.

    **Digital Twins**

        * Added Oregon State University's Large Wave Flume (``OSU LWF``) as a digital twin for ``MPM``.
        * Added Waseda University's Tsunami Wave Basin (``WU TWB``) as a digital twin for ``MPM``.
        * Digital twins now allow for debris and floating bodies.

    **DesignSafe Support and Hardware**

        * Multi-GPU accelerated simulations now supported in certain simulation types (e.g. ``ClaymoreUW MPM``).

        * Updated support for the TACC Frontera supercomputer:

            * Access the ``rtx`` queue. Includes 4 NVIDIA RTX Quadro 5000 GPUs (16GB memory each).

        * Added support for the TACC Lonestar6 supercomputer:

            * Access the ``gpu-a100-small`` queue. Includes 1 NVIDIA A100 GPU (40GB memory).

        * Updated support for the Tapis API used to run jobs remotely.

    **Tools**

        * Events (``EVT``) may now run as standalone tools (i.e. does not require a SimCenter workflow for UQ, etc.)
        * Added ``Tapis`` API support for running Tools remotely, allowing for specialized ``Tapis`` applications and system/queue selection


    **Examples**

        * Added example simulations for ``OSU LWF`` digital twin in ``FOAMySees``
