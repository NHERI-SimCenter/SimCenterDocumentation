DL: Damage and Loss Assessment
==============================

The Damage and Loss Assessment panel provides a convenient way to configure a damage and loss assessment calculation for a building. The dropdown list at the top of the panel lists the available tools for this task. Currently, the |app| uses the Pelicun engine - other options might be added in the future.
