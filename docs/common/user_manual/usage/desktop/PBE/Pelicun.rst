Pelicun
-------

Pelicun is a general-purpose damage and loss assessment engine that is designed to integrate various methods to support the analysis of multiple types of assets (e.g., buildings, bridges) under various hazards (e.g., seismic, wind, water). PBE provides a convenient interface to Pelicun to facilitate setting up and running damage and loss calculations. The interface in PBE aims to support the commonly used settings and analyses in Pelicun; advanced users are encouraged to take advantage of the full suite of features in Pelicun and running the engine directly using configuration files or Python scripts.

Pelicun uses four types of models to perform a damage and loss assessment calculation. Each of the models has its own tab in Pelicun's input panel. The fifth tab controls the types of outputs generated at the end of the calculation.
