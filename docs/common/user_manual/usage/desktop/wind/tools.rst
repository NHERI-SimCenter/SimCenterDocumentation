The main menu toolbar contains the tools dropdown menu. Tools in WE-UQ are applications that are provided to create inputs for certain workflow applications, e.g. the **Empty Domain CFD Simulation** tool will provide a way to calibrate wind profiles that will be used as input for the main wind load CFD simulation.
