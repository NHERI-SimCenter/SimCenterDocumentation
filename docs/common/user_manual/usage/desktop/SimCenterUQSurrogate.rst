Gaussian Process (GP) Surrogate Modeling
******************************************

.. Note:: 
     Surrogate modeling functionality of |short tool id| is built upon `GPy <https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/>`_ library (available under BSD 3-clause license), an opensource python framework for Gaussian process modeling developed in the Sheffield machine learning group. 

.. Warning::
     Update: 01.04.2024

     **Only on Mac**, the GPy module (v.1.12 or lower) has a dependency version compatibility issue with other python packages SimCenter uses. 
     To run GPy on SimCenter tools, one needs to install the latest developer release of GPy. Below is the error message you get.
     
     .. code:: console

        Surrogate modeling module uses GPy python package which is facing a version compatibility issue at this moment (01.05.2024). 
        To use the surrogate module, one needs to update manually the GPy version to 1.13. The instructions can be found in the documentation: 
        https://nheri-simcenter.github.io/quoFEM-Documentation/common/user_manual/usage/desktop/SimCenterUQSurrogate.html#lblsimsurrogate

     Until the GPy version v1.13 is available on pip, one can install the `developer release of GPy v1.13 <https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy>`_ by typing the following commands one by one in the terminal 

     .. code:: console

        git clone https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy.git
        cd GPy
        {$PathToPythonExe} -m pip uninstall GPy
        {$PathToPythonExe} setup.py install

     where ``{$PathToPythonExe}`` should be replaced with the python path found in the File-Preference window. After the third line, they will ask for the confirmation (type Y and enter). Check the installation status by typing
      
     .. code:: console

        {$PathToPythonExe} -m pip show GPy

     and confirming that the version appears as 1.13.x. For any questions and bug reports, please contact us through `user forum <https://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php>`_.

    The ``Train GP Surrogate Model`` module is used to construct a Gaussian process (GP) based **surrogate model** that substitutes expensive computational **simulation models** or physical experiments. Consider a simulation model, with input random variables (or parameters) :math:`\boldsymbol{x}` and output quantity of interests, denoted as :math:`\boldsymbol{y}=f(\boldsymbol{x})`. A surrogate model for the corresponding simulation model can be built by different user-provided information types (RV-random variables, QoI-quantities of interest):

    **Case 1 (Sampling and Simulation)**: The user provides lower and upper bounds of each random variable (RV) and a simulation model. |short tool id| will find the best training points sequentially by the adaptive **design of experiments** (DoE) strategies until the model converges or reaches a user-specified computational tolerance. 

    **Case 2 (Import RV Dataset and run Simulation)**: The user provides sample population of RVs as a separate text file. |short tool id| will run simulations to get QoI values and build a surrogate model. 

    **Case 3 (Import both RV and QoI Dataset)**: The user provides sample population of RVs and QoIs. |short tool id| will not run any simulations and build a surrogate model purely based on the provided dataset.

.. only:: EE-UQ

    The ``Train GP Surrogate Model`` module is used to construct a Gaussian process (GP) based **surrogate model** that substitutes expensive computational **simulation models**. The challenge of surrogate modeling in earthquake engineering arrives from the stochasticity in the ground motion time history and corresponding stochastic output.

       Surrogate Modeling in EE-UQ

    * **Output of surrogate model**: Following the performance-based earthquake engineering practice, the response estimation module in SimCenter workflow concerns only the peak responses (e.g. peak acceleration, peak drift ratio at each floor) rather than the whole time history. Therefore, the surrogate modeling algorithms in this tool are designed to predict the non-time history responses.

    * **Input of surrogate model**: To keep the input dimension of the surrogate model to a reasonable scale, the ground motion time history are first parameterized into a number of key features in the algorithm. This can be, for example, the sources properties (e.g. M,R) or time/frequency domain excitation property at the site of interest (e.g. intensity measures) ([Kyprioti2021]_, [Zhong2023]_).

    The surrogate prediction of EDP given the ground motion parameters typically inherits significant randomness, as the amount of information provided by these parameters are not sufficient to determine the exact model peak response. Therefore, the key task in surrogate modeling is to capture the remaining amount of uncertainty in the EDP predictions, as shown in the above figure.

    **The trained surrogate model can be saved in a portable file (.json format) and later imported** in place of the original simulation model for UQ analysis or optimization purposes. See user guide :ref:`section 2.2.5 <SIM-user_manual-EEUQsur>` for how to import the surrogate model in |short tool id|.

Input description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Case 1: Sampling and Simulation
--------------------------------

.. only:: EEUQ_app

    .. Note::
        Another SimCenter tool named `quoFEM <https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/research-tools/quofem-application/>`_ also supports surrogate modeling capability that shares the same algorithm with EE-UQ. However, quoFEM is targeted at more general applications not restricted to earthquake problems. quoFEM additionally supports different user-provided information types, allowing users to directly (i) Import RV Dataset and run the Simulation (Case 2), or (ii) Import both RV and EDP Dataset (Case 3). Currently, in EE-UQ, we only support the  Sampling and simulation option (Case 1).

When the **Training Dataset** option is set to the ``Sampling and Simulation``, a simulation model should be presented in the later tabs. The training points are sampled adaptively by the design of experiments.

* **Maximum Number of Model Runs**: When the number of simulation runs reaches the limit, the analysis will be terminated.
* **Maximum Computation Time (in minutes)**: When the tolerance limit of the computation time is reached, the analysis will be terminated. There will be a few minutes of error.
* **Target Accuracy (Normalized Error)**: The target accuracy is defined in terms of normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) estimated by leave-out-one cross-validation (LOOCV).

    .. math::
        :label: NRMSE

        \begin{align*}
            \rm{NRMSE} ~ &= \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum^{N}_{k=1} (y_k-\hat{y}_k)^2}}{\max_{k=1,...,N}(y_k)-\min_{k=1,...,N}(y_k)}
        \end{align*}    

   |   where 
   |      :math:`y_k` : exact response from the model simulation
   |      :math:`\hat{y}_k`: estimated response by LOOCV surrogate model prediction
   |      :math:`N`: number of samples used to train the surrogate model

* **Random Seed**: Seed of the random number generator
* **Parallel execution**: This engine implemented multiprocessing (local) or mpi4py (remote) python packages to run parallel execution.
Note that the results from the parallel and serial run may not be exactly the same because parallel execution sets the number of batch design of experiments (DoE) in order to maximize the use of resources (Default DoE interval: 5). User can also activate the following advanced options:

    Additionally, users may populate the initial samples directly from data files by activating. The following two data files are requested:

    * **Train Points (Input)**
    * **System Responses (Output)**

    where

    * Each text file is a numeric table with columns separated by a tab, space, or comma. Multiple headers can be presented following the symbol %. 
    * The number of rows corresponds to the number of training data samples.
    * Train Points (Input): The number of columns should match the number of RVs presented in the **RV tab** and also match the required inputs of the simulation model provided in the **FEM tab**. **The order of the columns should match those of the random variables presented in the RV tab** (See :numref:`figSim4` and :numref:`figSim7` for example.)
    * System Responses (Output): The number of columns and the order of columns should match the QoI quantities presented in **QoI tab**.
    * Both files need to be provided, and the number of columns for the two files should be the same.
    * See :numref:`figSim4` for example input data sheets.

    .. Note:: 

       * When the **Start with Existing Dataset** is checked, one redundant simulation will be performed in order to check the consistency between the data and the simulation model. An error will be thrown when the dataset cannot be reproduced by the simulation model.

    The user can select intensity measures (IMs) that will be used as auxiliary inputs of the surrogate model, in addition to those specified in the RV tab. If ground motions have more than one directional component, either each component's IM can be added as a separate surrogate input parameter, or they can be aggregated by using their geometric mean. The latter can be selected by checking 'Use geometric mean when 2 or more ground motion components are given'.

    Case 2: Import RV Dataset and run Simulation
    ----------------------------------------------
    When the **Training Dataset** option is set to ``Import Data File`` AND **Get results from datafile** check box is unchecked, |short tool id| will run simulations to get result (QoI) values for imported RV locations and build a surrogate model.

    * See :numref:`figSim4` (left) for an example data file.


    Case 3: Import both RV and QoI Dataset
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    When the **Training Dataset** option is set to ``Import Data File`` AND **Get results from datafile** check box is unchecked, |short tool id| will not run any simulations and build a surrogate model purely based on the user-provided dataset.

    where

    * Each text file is a numeric table with columns separated by a tab, space, or comma. Multiple headers can be presented following the symbol %. 
    * The number of columns corresponds to the number of training data samples.
    * The number of rows of each file respectively corresponds to the number of RVs and QoIs.
    * Both files need to be presented, and the number of columns should correspond to each other.
    * See :numref:`figSim4` for example data files.

    **FEM tab** will be inactivated in Case 3 as model information is not required.

    .. Tip::
        - Surrogate model training can be continued after termination by reusing RV and QoI samples obtained by the previous training.


    Multi-Fidelity Modeling
    -----------------------

    When a user provides two different models, i.e. high and low fidelity models, the surrogate model for the high fidelity can be constructed with better performance assisted by the low fidelity simulation results. The two models should share the same input RVs and output QoIs pools. Ideally, the combined model should have the best prediction better than each individual one, however, the benefit from the low fidelity model differs depending on the correlation between the two model outputs [Patsialis2021]_. Currently, the adaptive design of experiments capacity of the multi-fidelity surrogate modeling is NOT supported. 

    .. Note:: 
         Multi-fidelity surrogate modeling functionality of |short tool id| is built upon `emukit <https://emukit.github.io/>`_ library (available under Apache-2.0 license), an opensource python toolkit for emulation (surrogate modeling) and decision making under uncertainty.

    Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process can be trained by selecting 'Heteroscedastic' option in the 'Nugget Variance' field. The following two parameters are requested:

    * **Number of samples to be replicated (A)** : From the number of unique samples specified in the 'Number of Samples' field, decide how many of them will have replications. 
    * **Number of replications per sample (B)** : Specify how many replications will be generated for the number of samples specified in A.

Goodness-of-Fit
-----------------
Once the training is completed, the following three verification measures are presented based on leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) error estimation. 

* **Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)**

  | LOOCV prediction :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_k` at each sample location :math:`\boldsymbol{x}_k` is obatined by the following procedure: A temporary surrogate model :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}=f^{sur}_{loo,k}(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{x}})` is constructed using the samples :math:`\{\boldsymbol{x}_1,\boldsymbol{x}_2,...,\boldsymbol{x}_{k-1},\boldsymbol{x}_{k+1},...,\boldsymbol{x}_N\}` and the calibrated parameters, and the prediction :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_k=f^{sur}_{loo,k}(\boldsymbol{x}_k)` is compared with the exact outcome .


We provide different verification measures for two different cases.


.. only:: EEUQ_app
    
    .. Tip:: Due to the stochasticity in the ground motion, EE-UQ concerns case (ii).

(i) When nugget variance is low : The LOOCV prediction :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_k` is expected to match the exact outcome :math:`\boldsymbol{y_k}=f(\boldsymbol{x}_k)` when the surrogate model is well-trained. To quantify the goodness, R2 error, normalized root-mean-squared-error (NRMSE), and correlation coefficient are provided:

    * **R2 error**

      | R2 error is defined in terms of the total sum of squares over the residual sum of squares

        .. math::
            :label: R2

            \begin{align*}
                R^2 &= 1 - \frac{\sum^N_{k=1} (\hat{y}_k-\mu_\hat{y})^2}{\sum^N_{k=1} (\hat{y}_k-y_k)^2}
            \end{align*}    

      | The surrogate model is considered well-trained when the **R2 (<1) approaches 1**
     

    * **Normalized root-mean-squared-error (NRMSE)**

        .. math::
            :label: NRMSE

            \begin{align*}
                \rm{NRMSE} ~ &= \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{N_t} \sum^{N_t}_{k=1} (y_k-\hat{y}_k)^2}}{\max_{k=1,...,N_t}(y_k)-\min_{k=1,...,N_t}(y_k)}
            \end{align*}    

      | The surrogate model is considered well-trained when the **NRMSE (>0) approaches 0**

    * **Correlation coefficient**

      | Correlation coefficient is a statistic that measures linear correlation between two variables

      .. math::
        :label: corr

          \rho_{y,\hat{y}} = \frac{\sum^N_{k=1}(y_k-\mu_{y})(\hat{y}_k-\mu_{\hat{y}})} {\sigma_y \sigma_\hat{y}}


      |   where 
      |      :math:`\mu_{y}` : mean of :math:`\{y_k\}`
      |      :math:`\mu_{\hat{y}}`: mean of :math:`\{\hat{y}_k\}`
      |      :math:`\sigma_{y}`: standard deviation of :math:`\{y_k\}`
      |      :math:`\sigma_{\hat{y}}`: standard deviation of :math:`\{\hat{y}_k\}`

      | The surrogate model is considered well-trained when the **correlation coefficient (** :math:`-1<\rho<1` **) approaches 1**


(ii) When nugget variance is high : The distance between LOOCV prediction :math:`\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}_k` and the exact outcome :math:`\boldsymbol{y_k}=f(\boldsymbol{x}_k)` is expected to follow a normal distribution when the surrogate model is well-trained. To quantify the goodness, inter-quartile ratio (IQR) and Cramer-Von Mises statistics can be evaluated:

    * **Inter-quartile ratio (IQR)**: IQR provides the ratio of the sample QoIs that lies in 25-75% LOOCV prediction bounds (interquartile range). The IQR values should theoretically approach 0.5 if the prediction is accurate.

    * **Cramer-Von Mises statistics**: Cramer-Von Mises statistics calculate the normality score. The assumption of a GP is that the observations follow a normal distribution conditional on the input parameters. To assess the normality of the model predictions, the difference between the mean prediction :math:`\hat{y}_k` and the sample observation  :math:`y_k` value is divided by the standard deviation prediction from surrogate :math:`\hat{\sigma}_{y,k}`:

      .. math::
        :label: normed

          u_k = \frac{y_k-\hat{y}_k} {\hat{\sigma}_{y,k}}


     If the values of :math:`{u_k}` follow the standard normal distribution, the resulting surrogate model may be considered well-constructed. The Cramer-Von Mises test is calculated using the ``scipy.stats.cramervonmises`` function in the Python package Scipy, and the resulting p-value is displayed. Conventionally, if the p-value exceeds a significance threshold, e.g. 0.05, the null hypothesis that the samples are from a normal distribution is not rejected, meaning the samples may be considered to follow a Gaussian distribution.


Additionally, **scatter plot** between the predicted and exact responses is presented: Well-trained model will form a clear diagonal line in case (i), or be distributed normally around the diagonal line in case (ii). A poorly trained model will have points that are more scattered around.

   Well-trained surrogate (left) and poorly trained surrogate (right) models

.. Note:: 
     Since these validation measures are calculated from the cross-validation predictions, they can be **biased**, particularly when a highly localized nonlinear range exists in the actual response surface, and those regions are not covered by the training samples. The introduction of adaptive design of experiments helps to suppress the bias by enabling the targeted selection of simulation points around potentially faulty regions.

.. Warning:: 
     Note that GP-based surrogate models can be used to fit only smooth, continuous functions. When the surrogate model is poorly trained, a parametric study is highly recommended to check any possible discontinuity presented in the simulation model.


Saving Options
--------------
* **Save GP Model**: The constructed surrogate model is saved. One main file and one auxiliary folder will be saved.

   - **SurroateGP Info File** (default name: ``SimGpModel.json``) : This file contains information required to quickly reconstruct the surrogate model and predict the response for different input realizations. This can be later imported in EEUQ.
   - **Simulation template directory** (default name: ``tmplatedir_SIM``) : This folder contains all the scripts and commands to run the original dynamic time history analysis. This folder can later be imported into EEUQ along with the surrogate model to alternate between original simulations and surrogate predictions or compare the surrogate predictions to the response of the original model. 

   - Only for the multi-fidelity case in quoFEM, additional **SurroateGP model file** (default name: ``SimGpModel.pkl``) will be written along with the above two.


.. warning::

   Do not place above surrogate model files in your root, downloads, or desktop folder as when the application runs it will copy the contents on the directories and subdirectories containing these files multiple times. If you are like us, your root, Downloads or Documents folders contains and awful lot of files and when the backend workflow runs you will slowly find you will run out of disk space!

* **Save GP Info**: This is a report generated for user reference. It contains the GP model parameter and other information. The default file name is ``GPresults.out``.
* **RV Data**, **QoI Data**:It saves the samples of RV and QoI. The default file names are ``X.txt`` and ``Y.txt``, respectively. **IMPORTANT**: To continue surrogate modeling with additional simulations, save the RV and QoI sample files using this button and import them as initial points. Refer to the 'Start with Existing Dataset' option in Case 1.
