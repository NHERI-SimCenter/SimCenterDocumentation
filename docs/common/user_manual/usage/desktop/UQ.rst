UQ: Uncertainty Quantification
==============================

The first selection panel the user must select from and enter data into is the **UQ** tab. It is in this panel that the user selects the **UQ Engine** to use for performing the uncertainty quantification calculations. The **UQ Engine** provides algorithms for solving various types of uncertainty analysis and optimization problems. 

.. role:: uqblue

.. only:: quoFEM_app
     
   The **UQ Engine** options currently available are Dakota, SimCenterUQ, and UCSD-UQ. Users can also configure |appName| to use their own UQ methods and algorithms in the |appName| workflow by selecting the CustomUQ option.

   The **UQ Engine** options currently available are Dakota and SimCenterUQ


Dakota UQ Engine
----------------

This UQ engine utilizes the `Dakota Software <https://dakota.sandia.gov/>`_, a state-of-the-art research application that is robust and provides many methods for optimization and UQ, a selection of which we utilize in this application. **Dakota** provides the user with a large number of methods for different kinds of analyses. For this reason, we have divided the methods into categories through a pull-down menu, as shown below. Once the category has been selected, a number of different methods are made available to the user.

* By checking the ``Parallel Execution``, the UQ analysis will be performed in parallel. It will try to use all the processors available on the machine. 

* By checking the ``Save Working dirs``, individual working directories will be saved in the Local Jobs Directory. Local Jobs Directory is defined at ``File``-``Preference`` in the menubar. Otherwise, individual simulation files will be deleted after each simulation run. Users might uncheck this box when a large number of simulations is requested, to manage driver space.

   UCSD UQ Engine
   --------------

   The **UCSD-UQ** engine is a module developed at the SimCenter in collaboration with UCSD. It provides algorithms for Bayesian estimation, which can be accessed through a pull-down menu, as shown in :numref:`figUCSDUQ`.

      UCSD-UQ engine and category selection.

   This module currently offers support for Bayesian estimation of the parameters of a traditional (non-hierarchical) model using the Transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC) algorithm and of a hierarchical model using an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs sampling algorithm.

   Custom UQ Engine
   ----------------

   The **CustomUQ** option enables users to switch out the UQ engine in the |appName| workflow such that different methods and tools can be applied within the SimCenter framework with minimal effort on the part of the user. The CustomUQ option can be accessed as shown below:

      CustomUQ engine selection.

   In order to use the CustomUQ engine option, two steps are required:

   * Configuring the UQ tab to accept the required inputs
   * Adding UQ engine to customized UQ backend
