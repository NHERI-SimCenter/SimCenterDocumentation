**Version 3.1.0** of |app| was released **October 2023**. The following lists the functionality available in this current version. (Note: New features and fixes in this release are marked :blue:`blue` in the following list of features.)


Structural Information Model
============================

Applications are used to specify/select the structural model to be used in the analysis.

#. MDOF: creating idealized multi-degree-of-freedom models
#. MDOF-LU: auto-generated multi-degree-of-freedom model     
#. OpenSees: user-defined OpenSees models
#. CustomPy: user-defined OpenSees models

    
Wind Loading Event
=======================

Applications used to specify/select wind loading for the structure.

#.  Stochastic Wind: simulating stochastic wind speed using spectral method
#.  CFD-Digital Wind Tunnel: CFD simulation of boundary layer wind tunnel
#.  :blue:`CFD-Wind Load on Isolated Buildings: CFD-based wind load simulation for isolated buildings with complex geometry`
#.  DEDM_HRP: database-enabled design framework based on wind-tunnel data for high-rise buildings 
#.  LowRiseTPU: extracting aerodynamics loads based on TPU database for low-rise buildings
#.  Wind Tunnel Experiment: uses pressure tap measurements from building in wind tunnel experiment
#.  Existing: User-supplied time-varying floor loads


Engineering Demand Parameter Generator
======================================

Applications to identify the output parameters of interest given the wind loading and the structural model.

#. Standard Wind: (serviceability) inter-story drift ratio, peak floor acceleration
#. User Defined: user-specified EDP
    
    
Finite Element Application
==========================

Applications used to determine the response output parameters given the ground motion and structural model.

#.  OpenSees: Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation
#.  CustomPy: Any user-supplied Python application can be incorporated
