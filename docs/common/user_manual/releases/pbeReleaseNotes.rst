Version 3
=========

   .. dropdown::    Version 3.4 (:blue:`Current`)
      :open:

      **Release date:** March 2024

      **Major updates:**

      - Ability to select from Physics based ground motions generated by M9 project

      - Update the Pelicun3 Damage and Loss engine to v3.3:

          - Changes affecting backwards compatibility

              - Remove "bldg" from repair consequence output filenames: The increasing scope of PBE now covers simulations for transportation and water networks. Hence, labeling repair consequence outputs as if they were limited to buildings no longer seems appropriate. The bldg label was dropped from the following files: DV_bldg_repair_sample,DV_bldg_repair_stats,DV_bldg_repair_grp, DV_bldg_repair_grp_stats, DV_bldg_repair_agg, DV_bldg_repair_agg_stats.

              - Decision variable types in the repair consequence outputs are named using CamelCase: Earlier they used all capitals. This change was made to be consistent with other parts of the codebase. For example, we use "Cost" instead of "COST". This might affect post-processing scripts.

              - "ea" units were replaced with "unitless" where appropriate for clarity: There should be no practical difference between the calculations due to this change. Interstory drift ratio demand types are one example.

              - Weighted component block assignment is no longer supported: We recommend using more versatile approach of defining the same component type multiple times to achieve the same effect.

              - Damage functions are no longer supported: Damage functions were used to assign quantity of damage as a function of demand. Contrast this with fragility curves that assign probability of limit state exceedance as a function of demand. We recommend using the new multilinear CDF type fragility functions to develop theoretically equivalent, but more efficient models.

          - Deprecation warnings

              - Remove Bldg from repair settings label in DL configuration file: Following the changes above, we dropped Bldg from BldgRepair when defining settings for repair consequence simulation in a configuration file. The previous version (i.e., BldgRepair) will keep working until the next major release, but we encourage everyone to adopt the new approach and simply use the Repair keyword in the input files.

	  - New features

              - Location-specific damage processes: This new feature is useful when you want damage to a component type to induce damage in another component type at the same location only. For example, damaged water pipes on a specific story can trigger damage in floor covering only on that specific story. Location-matching is performed automatically without you having to define component pairs for every location using the following syntax: '1_CMP.A-LOC', {'DS1': 'CMP.B_DS1'} , where DS1 of CMP.A at each location triggers DS1 of CMP.B at the same location.

              - Multilinear CDF random variable: allows using a multilinear approximation of any CDF in the tool.
      
              - Allow multiple definitions of the same component type at the same location and direction in the asset model. (If needed, we can later add a feature to propagate these as separate instances to model, e.g., components used by various tenants.)

              - Update JSON outputs to follow new standard SimCenter output format

              - Include unit information in every CSV and JSON output file.

              - Several minor efficiency improvements that lead to faster runtimes - major improvments in that area are coming in the next minor release

              - Several error and warning messages added to provide more meaningful information when something goes wrong in a simulation.

              - A lot of minor bugs fixed and robustness of the Pelicun engine ensured by bringing back continuous integration.

      - Post-disaster Performance and Recovery Simulation

         - Integrated the `ARUP REDi Seismic Downtime Model <https://sgavrilovicarup.github.io/REDi-docs/#>`_ using the open-source `PyREDI package <https://github.com/arup-group/REDi>`_ as the first tool in the PBE App to support functional recovery calculations.
         - Example 3 is added to illustrate this new functionality.

      - All features of EE-UQ up to v3.4, including:
         
         - Multi Fidelity Monte Carlo (MFMC) method for modeling building response

      - Damage and Loss Database (DBDL)

         - A collection of parameters and metadata for damage and loss models for performance based engineering. The DBDL is available and updated regularly in the `DB_DamageAndLoss <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/DB_DamageAndLoss>`_ GitHub Repository.

            - FEMA P-58 Second Edition
            - Hazus Earthquake Model for Buildings
            - Hazus Earthquake Model for Transportation Assets

         - Included in documentation

      - Environmental Impacts as per FEMA P-58 included in DBDL and available in the new release.

      - New Outputs tab allows users to select the outputs they need (across asset, demand, damage, and loss information) and if they prefer them in CSV or JSON format. 

      - Support automatic combination of built-in and user-defined databases for damage and loss models.

      - Support running calculations for only a subset of available consequence types.

   .. warning::

      Major releases break compatibility. Input files used for PBE 2.x will need to be converted to work with the PBE 3.x versions.

Version 2
=========

   .. dropdown::    Version 2.0.0

      **Release date:** October 2019

      Major updates:

      - Update DL interface:

          - General settings are organized around Damage, Response, and Loss Models
