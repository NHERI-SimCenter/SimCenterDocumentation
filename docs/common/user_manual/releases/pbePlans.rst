The following features are planned to be developed for upcoming releases of |app|. We are actively working on the features in the next release. Farther development priorities may change depending on feedback from the community. If you have any suggestions, we encourage you to contribute and contact us through the SimCenter Forum.
   
Apr 2024
--------

    #. Facilitate wind damage and loss calculations by adding relevant vulnerability and loss components. The building-level components from the Hazus Hurricane Methodology will be complemented by components from recent research that supports higher resolution analyses. (1.3.5.1)

    #. Integrate additional functional recovery simulation engines, starting with the ATC 138 methodology. TREADS, and F-Rec are planned for the second half of 2024. This will enable benchmarking and further development of these methods
	
	
Sept 2024
----------

   #. Facilitate water damage and loss calculation by adding relevant vulnerability and loss components. The building-level components from the Hazus Flood Methodology will be complemented by components from recent research that supports higher resolution analyses (1.3.5.2)
   
   #. Automatic access to physics-based ground motion simulation results (1.1.1.3)
