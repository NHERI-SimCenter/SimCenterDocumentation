The following features are planned to be developed for upcoming releases of |app|. Development priorities may change depending on feedback from the community and our users. For suggestions or to contribute, we encourage you to reach out via the `SimCenter Forum <http://simcenter-messageboard.designsafe-ci.org/smf/index.php?board=8.0&_gl=1*1mybwj*_ga*NzI5NDMzMDUzLjE2ODU0ODE2MzQ.*_ga_D96RT1T24K*MTcxNDc3MzkxMy4zMTEuMC4xNzE0NzczOTEzLjAuMC4w>`_.


June 2024
----------
#. **Water Distribution Network, Buried Pipelines** (1.3.4.3): Add modeling capabilities for buried water pipelines and other water distribution infrastructure.

#. **Efficient Forward Propagation using Multi-Fidelity Monte-Carlo** (1.2.3.1): This feature leverages a small number of high-fidelity model outputs to improve the accuracy of efficient, approximate models, such as surrogates, enhancing performance with minimal computational overhead.

#. **Add Datasets to Simulate Subassembly Damage and Losses Under Wind Demands** (1.3.5.1): Incorporation of damage and loss data published in recent Performance-Based Wind Engineering research to facilitate high-resolution wind hazard performance assessments. The data is added to the `SimCenter Damage and Loss Model Library <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/DamageAndLossModelLibrary>`_. 

#. **Probabilistic Asset Inventories** (1.3.6.2): Calibrate, store, and propagate uncertainties in building features at the regional scale. Probabilistically fill in missing building features using the known information.

Sep 2024
----------
#. **Access to Physics-Based Ground Motion Simulation Results** (1.1.1.3): Integration of physics-based ground motion simulation data into hazard assessments.

#. **Add Datasets to Simulate Subassembly Damage and Losses Under Water Hazard Demands** (1.3.5.2): Expansion of the `SimCenter Damage and Loss Model Library <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/DamageAndLossModelLibrary>`_ to include water hazard-specific damage and loss models.

#. **Add Datasets to Simulate High-Resolution Damages and Losses in Buried Pipeline Networks** (1.3.5.4): Expansion of the `SimCenter Damage and Loss Model Library <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/DamageAndLossModelLibrary>`_ to include detailed water pipeline damage and loss models.

Dec 2024
---------
#. **Model Interdependencies Between Physical Components, Housing, Socio-economic Functions, and Lifelines** (1.3.4.6): Incorporation models and simulation programs to capture the interdependencies between physical and socio-economical components.

#. **Add Datasets to Simulate High-Resolution Damages and losses in Transportation Networks** (1.3.5.3): Expansion of the `SimCenter Damage and Loss Model Library <https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenter/DamageAndLossModelLibrary>`_ to detailed transportation infrastructure damage and loss models.

#. **Develop and implement metrics and their visualization to inform recovery and community resilience** (1.4.3.2): Development of new metrics and visualization tools to support recovery planning and community resilience assessment.

Sept 2025
---------
#. **Multi-Fidelity Models in Regional Simulations** (1.3.3.1): Introduction of multi-fidelity modeling approaches for enhanced regional simulation capability.

#. **Multi-Scale Models for Wind and Water** (1.3.3.2): Development of multi-scale modeling capabilities for wind and water hazard assessment.
