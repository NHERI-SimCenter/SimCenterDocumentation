The |app| project at the NHERI SimCenter, an NSF funded initiative, is going dormant for the foreseeable future due to changes in funding priorities. SimCenter alumni and associates will continue to provide support for HydroUQ within reason. 

The best points of contact are `Justin Bonus <mailto:bonus@berkeley.edu>`_ and `Pedro Arduino <mailto:parduino@uw.edu>`_.

Thank you for your interest in HydroUQ!
