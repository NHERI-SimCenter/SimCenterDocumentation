Install Location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following set of instructions assumes all files will be placed in the **bin** folder in your home directory. You can of course place them anywhere you want, you just need to make appropriate changes to the **env PATH** settings discussed later. If you wish to follow our placement strategy, inside this **bin** folder create two additional folders named ``dakota`` and ``OpenSees``.

.. note::

   Placement of terminal applications in your home **bin** folder is common practice for the terminal applications on a **MacOS** system. It is a legacy practice from the operating system's Linux heritage.

Python
^^^^^^

The Mac comes with Python pre-installed, which is currently the somewhat 
dated version 2.7. We recommend installing Python 3.7 from `Python.org <https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx>`_ . We recommend installing using the 
**macOS 64-bit installer**. The installer used to place a python3 executable in your /usr/local/bin directory, whose location should be on your system PATH, Version 3.8 does not appear to do so anymore, see the note below. 

.. note:: 
   #. We use the python.org installation over others, due to its simplicity of installation.
   #. In the current installation of **Python** it leaves two script files in a folder when the installation ends. You need to execute both script files to get Python set up correctly so that it can be invoked from the terminal. To execute the files, double click on them. The two files, shown in the image below, are **Update Shell Profile.command.sh** and **Install CertificateCommand.sh**.

Once Python is installed, you need to extend it by installing the following packages: **numpy**, **scipy**, and **pandas**. To install these packages, start a terminal window and type the following instructions:

.. code-block:: python

      pip3 install numpy
      pip3 install scipy
      pip3 install pandas
      pip3 install tables
      pip3 install hdf5

.. note:: 
   #. To start a terminal window you can use the spotlight app (magnifying glass at the top right corner of the desktop). Start the spotlight app and type in the terminal. The terminal application should appear as the top hit. Click on it to start it.

   #. When the |app| is running, open the File/Preferences and make sure that python3 appears under **External Applications:Python**. If you used older versions of SimCenter tools this was not the default.

   #. If you forget to invoke the **UpdateShellProfile.command.sh" script at the end of the installation, you can always edit the correct shell file later to add the **PATH** variable. 

  #. As an alternative, you can install the SimCenter's pelicun module, which will include all three of the above

   .. code-block:: python

      pip install pelicun


Dakota
^^^^^^

|DakotaLink| is the default UQ engine used by the |app| that is publicly available from the |DakotaDownload| page. The download page offers an extensive list of downloadable files. You can narrow this down to the file to be selected by selecting **MacOS** in the `Platform`, **6.10** in the `Release`, and **Command Line Only** for the `interface type`. In the `Public`
area you should now only have a single option, click on the link to download |Dakota|. When you extract the files that you download, they will all be contained in a single folder. Rename this folder **dakota-6.10.0** and move that folder to your **bin/dakota** folder.

OpenSees
^^^^^^^^

|OpenSeesLink| is the default FEM engine used by the |app| that is publicly available from the |OpenSeesDownload| page. To download the **OpenSees** you have to enter your email address, which may also require you to register (that requirement is going away and may be gone by the time you read this). At the bottom of the page under the section **Mac Version** is a table with two links: one for the **OpenSees** and also a link to |Tcl|, whose libraries OpenSees needs on your computer to run. You will need to follow both links to download both applications.

Steps to Install OpenSees on a Mac:
      1. Follow the OpenSees link and download the OpenSees.zip file. Uncompress the file and you will have an **OpenSees-3.2.2** folder. Move that folder to the **bin/OpenSees** folder. 
      2. Download and run the Tcl installer.


.. note::

   The additional requirement of installing **Tcl** was removed from the |OpenSees| installation process with version **3.2.2**. 

Edit Your Shell file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On Linux systems, the shell is the program that takes commands from the keyboard that you enter in the terminal window and passes them to the operating system to perform by invoking applications and passing data between applications. In the good old days, it was the only interface available to the user, i.e. there was no such thing as Finder! There are a number of shell programs that can be installed and made available to you. The most popular is the **bash** shell, the up and the up-and-coming one is the **Z** shell. Power MacOS users will write shell scripts to do many many useful things. By default the applications that the shell program will invoke are limited to applications in a few specific directories that are defined in the user's **PATH**. Users can modify this path by editing files that the shell program will read from every time the program is started.

When the frontend application is running the computations it is actually running a backend application using the shell program. As a consequence the shell program must be made aware of the locations of some of the external applications that you have installed as **OpenSees** and **dakota** do not provide installers that automatically do this when they are installed. Other applications, like **Tcl** provide scripts that you invoke to do it. In short, you have to edit the file appropriate to the shell you are using.

To find which shell program you are using when you issue commands inside the terminal window, type the following in a terminal window:

.. code:: none
   
   env | grep SHELL

If the result is **/bin/bash** you will need to edit the **.bashrc** file or the **bash_profile** file. If the result is **/bin/zsh** you will need to edit the **.zshrc** or **.zprofile**. Typically the **.bash_profile** or the **.zprofile** file is the one to edit as these typically by design will invoke the **.bashrc** or **.zshrc** file. If in doubt, look for the files and see where **Python** placed its modifications. In your home directory type:

.. code:: none
   
   env | grep SHELL


Finally, you want to edit that file so that the applications will find |OpenSees| and |Dakota|. The format depends on the shell, just copy the format that Python used, e.g. my **.bash_profile** file has the lines:

.. code:: none
   
   export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
   export PATH=$HOME/bin/dakota-6.10.0/bin:$PATH
   export PYTHONPATH=$HOME/bin/dakota-6.10.0/share/dakota/Python

.. note:
   #. Apple in MacOS Catalina has moved from users defaulting to the **bash** shell to the **Z** shell. As a consequence, the name of the files to edit has changed from **.bash_profile** to the **.zprofile**. 
   #. If you upgrade your system from an older version of the operating system, it keeps your old shell preferences. You can confirm your current shell by typing in a terminal **env | grep shell**.

Test the Install of Python, OpenSees & Dakota
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Steps to Test the Installation of the Applications:
   1. Open a terminal window (type ``terminal`` in spotlight search)
   2. Type ``python3`` (this should bring up the Python interpreter)
   3. Enter the following to test the installation of the modules and quit the application:
   
   .. code:: python

      import numpy
      import scipy
      import pandas
      quit()

   4. Type ``OpenSees`` (this should bring up the OpenSees interpreter).

   5. Enter the following to exit this program:
   
   .. code:: tcl

      exit

   6. Type ``dakota`` (this should start the Dakota application which should give some error messages).

.. note::

   Apple, in the latest release of their operating system, MacOS 10.16 Catalina, has changed the default working of Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper, first introduced in OS X Mountain Lion, is a Mac security feature that helps protect your Mac from Malware and other malicious software. Gatekeeper checks to make sure the application is safe to run by checking it against the list of apps that Apple has vetted and approved for the Apple Mac Store and/or approved by Apple even if not offered through the app store. In previous versions of MacOS, Gatekeeper had three security level options: App Store, App Store and Identified Developers, and Anywhere. Anywhere has been removed and this will cause problems with Dakota.

   Apple has greatly increased security with **Catalina** and now by default terminal applications can no longer run if they are downloaded from the internet and not signed by a recognized Apple developer. To overcome this issue, before you start issuing the above commands in a terminal, open **System Preferences/Security and Privacy**. As you issue the commands, click the **Cancel** button in the window that pops warning you the **application cannot be opened because the Developer cannot be verified** up and then click the button **Allow Anyway** that now appears beside the application name in the **Security and Privacy** window, as shown in the figure below. Rerun the application and it should now work without the warning window popping up.

   .. figure:: figures/macSecurity.png

      Catalina: Security and Privacy Panel for Unsigned Terminal Applications.

.. warning:: 

   **Dakota** has even more trouble installing on Catalina. Not only is the developer not known, but the application relies on code from other unsigned developers. As a consequence, the above workaround for most terminal applications fails. For dakota, in the terminal, we have to turn off gatekeeper even after we have o.k.'d the application for running. Issue the following commands inside the terminal window:

   .. code:: none

      	     sudo spctl --master-disable
      	     dakota
      	     sudo spctl --master-enable

   This will temporarily disable gatekeeper (basically setting Gatekeeper options to Anywhere), allow the Dakota application and its ``.dylib`` files to be registered as safe, and then turn Gatekeeper options back to default.
