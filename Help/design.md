<h1>Documentation Design Philosophy</h1>

This document proposes a general approach for the design and layout of SimCenter documentation websites.

Every website is assumed to be associated with one clearly identifiable **primary application**. Websites are divided into structured **documents** which identify a target **audience**.

## User Manual

### Audience: `Base User`

This document is targeted at *base users* of the **primary application**. Documentation catering to this user must make the following accommodations:

- [ ] Coding experience?
    - [x] control flow (`if`/`then`, `for`) ?
    - [ ] tcl?
    - [ ] C/C++ tools chains?
- [ ] Command line?
    - [ ] option parsing?
    - [ ] streams/pipes?
    - [ ] ssh?

## Technical Manual

### Audience: `Engaging User`

This document is targeted at *engaging users* of the **primary application**.

- [ ] Coding experience?
    - [x] control flow (`if`/`then`, `for`) ?
    - [ ] tcl?
    - [ ] C/C++ tools chains?

## Developer Manual:

Throughout this manual, care should be taken to identify how the concepts presented are abstracted away by the primary application.

### Audience: `Developing User`

A **developing user** is one that may be expected to engage in software development. The following assumptions are made:


### Components

####  How to Build

####  Software Architecture

##### File Types and Schemas

This section should NOT include any files which a **base user** may be required to prepare.

##### Workflow (Backend) Applications

This section should begin by clearly defining what is meant by a "backend application"

##### Creating Workflows

This section should begin by clearly defining what is meant by a "workflow". 

##### Running Manually # (Manually Building Workflows)

##### C4 Model of Framework

#### Coding Style

## Front Matter (About)

This section contains meta and reference material that is relevant to the project or primary application as a whole, but disruptive to a particular document structure.

### Audience: `General`

For the most part the material of this section should be generally understandable by anybody. Absolutely no technical background should be assumed.
